# FaceRecognition

This repository contains Python scripts for face data collection, face detection, and face recognition using the OpenCV library and the DeepFace framework.

## Contents

- [facedata.py](facedata.py): Script to capture and store facial data for recognition.
- [facedetect.py](facedetect.py): Script to detect faces in real-time using Haar Cascade.
- [facerecog.py](facerecog.py): Script to perform face recognition using DeepFace.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- OpenCV
- DeepFace
- NumPy

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python deepface numpy
```

## Usage

### 1. Face Data Collection

Run the `facedata.py` script to capture and store facial data for recognition:

```bash
python facedata.py
```

### 2. Face Detection

Run the `facedetect.py` script to detect faces in real-time using Haar Cascade:

```bash
python facedetect.py
```

### 3. Face Recognition

Run the `facerecog.py` script to perform face recognition using DeepFace:

```bash
python facerecog.py
```

## Acknowledgments

- The face detection uses Haar Cascade, and the face recognition employs the DeepFace framework.


Feel free to contribute and improve the functionality!
